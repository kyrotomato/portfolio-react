## My Portfolio-React.JS
## Description
This is a personal portfolio I made for myself using HTML, CSS, and the React.JS library to create a dynamic portfolio with mobile responsiveness. 
I also am striving to support thinner phones such as galaxy fold. I have thoroughly tested to make sure no compatibility issues occur, if any please contact me so I
can fix them.
This portfolio uses react paired with javascript and CSS to serve files dynamically.
