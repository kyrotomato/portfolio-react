                About Me!
            </h1>
            <p>This will be a paragraph talking about my accomplishments that I most likely will have to change a bunch of times
                currently I am just throwing all this in here so I have a lot of text. I will talk about my troubleshooting experience and all that jazz.
                Try to take this time to elaborate to employers that I have a diverse skill set, not just what I learned in this bootcamp.
                Maybe mention something about high school robotics.
            </p>
            <p2>This paragraph will be a summary, and an explanation of my soft skills. This paragraph shouldnt be as long but is still really important</p2>
        </section>
